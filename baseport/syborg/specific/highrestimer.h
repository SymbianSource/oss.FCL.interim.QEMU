 * Reads the 32-bit value from a free-running counter that represents the current time. 
 * Syborg timers have 'microsecond resolution'. NB. This value comes from the host clock
 * and so there is a good chance that the kernels tick based notion of time (elapsed) and that
 * measured by the free running timer will get out of kilter. This affects t_cputime from e32test
 * amongst other things.
