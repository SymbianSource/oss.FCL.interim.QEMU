        <title>QEMU user-mode debugging improvements</title>
        <para>
          The QEMU user-mode emulator now reports all fatal signals
          (except <literal>SIGKILL</literal>) to the debugger.  A bug
          that caused the debugger interface to malfunction when an
          application called the <function>fork</function> function
          has also been fixed.

        <title>QEMU single-stepping fix</title>
        <para>
	  A bug in QEMU has been fixed that caused incorrect results or a QEMU crash
	  when running applications under the control of the debugger.  The bug affected
	  single-stepping over branch instructions, including step operations performed
	  implicitly by the debugger
	  <phrase target-os="linux">on program startup or</phrase>
	  when continuing from a breakpoint.

        <para>
	  A bug has been fixed that prevented the QEMU user-mode
	  emulator from running on some Linux hosts.  The bug caused
	  QEMU to exit immediately with the error message
	  <literal>mmap: No such device or address</literal>.

          QEMU now supports the <trademark>AltiVec</trademark>
          instruction set extensions.  To build programs containing
          AltiVec instructions, use the <option>-te600</option>
          command-line option.  To run programs containing AltiVec
          instructions, use the <option>--cpu 7400</option> command-line
	  option when starting QEMU.

          A bug that caused the GDB interface in the QEMU user-mode emulator
          to malfunction when an application called the
          <function>fork</function> function has been fixed.  It is now
          possible to continue debugging the parent process after it has

        <title>Kernel version reported by QEMU</title>
        <para>
	  The Linux kernel version reported by the QEMU user-mode emulator 
	  now defaults to the minimum version required by the included 
	  GNU C library, rather than that of the host Linux system.
	  This fixes problems with <literal>FATAL: kernel too old</literal>
	  errors when running QEMU on hosts with older kernels.

          &csl_prod; now includes the QEMU user-mode emulator for Linux

          QEMU uses just-in-time translation of target machine instructions
          to provide high-performance simulation of target applications.
          System calls on the &csl_target_name; target are translated
          into corresponding calls on the host Linux system.

          The GDB instruction-set simulator has been replaced with QEMU.
          QEMU uses just-in-time translation of target machine instructions
          to provide high-performance simulation of target applications.
          Note that QEMU was provided as an undocumented feature in a
          previous release, but it is now invoked differently; you can now
          run QEMU from GDB using the new 
          <command>target qemu</command> command.
